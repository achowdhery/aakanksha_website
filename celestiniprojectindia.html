<p>Our Young Scholars are passionate about working with students in developing countries to help solve important social problems.  This work, called the <a href="http://marconisociety.org/ys-celestini-project/">Celestini Program</a>, has successfully improved the health of pregnant women in Uganda and expanded to India in 2017 in partnership with IIT Delhi.</p>

	<h2>Brief summary of 2018 competition</h2>
<p> More than one hundred students expressed interest in working on the program during the  summer and three student teams (comprising of eight students) were selected. 
	They chose problem statements related to air pollution and road safety in New Delhi were selected. 
</p>

	<p><b> Air Pollution:</b>Preserving the air quality is a critical challenge in the industrial and urban areas of many emerging economies. 
	According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) global air pollution database released in Geneva, 
	India has 14 out of the 15 most polluted cities in the world in terms of PM 2.5 
	concentrations. One potential solution is to increase awareness of the problem by 
	enabling users to understand and track the level of air pollution, 
		providing the basis for taking effective pollution control measures. </p>
     
		  
	

<p>Approach of one team: Develop a temporal forecasting solution based on the historical data reported by Central Pollution Control board
	to predict the 
	real-time and fine-grained air quality information in five locations of Delhi. 
<div class="row">
  <div class="column">	<ul>
  <li>Air quality prediction of major air pollutants over the next 24 hours.</li>
  <li>Tracks daily and 
	seasonal variations of the major pollutants</li>
  <li>Identify potential sources</li>
</ul>
<ul>Results:
  <li> Developed an advanced machine learning model called CLair using LSTM techniques.</li>
  <li>Deployed their solution on Google Cloud Platform to automatically 
	generate predictions Tracks daily and 
	seasonal variations of the major pollutants</li>
  <li>Predictions updated every few hours on this <a href="http://35.229.111.190:8000/home/">website</a> for five Delhi locations 
  </li>
<li>Demo <a href="https://youtu.be/l7-dK4eKxG0">youtube video</a></li>
</ul>

        var ctrlq = document.getElementById("youtube-player1");
        var player = new YT.Player('youtube-player1', {
          height: ctrlq.dataset.height,
          width: ctrlq.dataset.width,
          events: {
            'onReady': function(e) {
              e.target.mute();
              e.target.cueVideoById({ 
                videoId: ctrlq.dataset.video,
                startSeconds: ctrlq.dataset.startseconds,
                endSeconds: ctrlq.dataset.endseconds
              });
            }
          } 
        }); 
      } 
    </script>
    
	<div data-video = "Smbb32Bcrf4"

         data-width = "240" 
         id = "youtube-player1">
    </div>
	
<p>Temporal forecasting can predict the air pollution levels in locations where 
	the Delhi Government provides air quality data hourly, but this is limited to specific locations. 
	A scalable approach requires crowdsourcing where we use inputs from the 
	entire population and the easiest way to leverage crowdsourcing via smartphone applications 
	widely used by Delhi residents.  
	Toward this goal, one of the student teams developed an Android smartphone application called Air Cognizer. 
	This applications allows users to upload an input image of the sky horizon taken from 
	their smartphone camera. Based on the certain features of the sky, such as how blue it is, 
	the app predicts air quality particulate matter indicator, PM2.5 concentration, with an error less than 5%. 
	The application uses image processing with machine learning using Tensorflow Lite to 
	generate estimates by combining a pre-training machine learning model with a model trained 
	online for each location based on all the user-uploaded photos. Two key challenges that students 
	solve are preprocessing the data collected from different smartphone cameras so that the machine 
	learning model works accurately and deploying this machine learning model on the smartphone 
	with Tensorflow Lite to enable a low-latency real-time prediction experience. 
	This <a href="https://youtu.be/Smbb32Bcrf4">youtube video</a> provides a sample of the application that the team will launch by the end of year. </p>

	<p><b>Road Safety:</b> Another challenging problem that the student teams worked on was road safety. 
	Over 200,000 people in India lost their lives in road accidents in 2015. 
	Traffic accidents are the top cause of death for people aged 19-25. 
	In Delhi, many of these accidents are caused by buses hitting pedestrians and cyclists. 
	This year, a student team worked on prototype solution that allows multiple vehicles to talk to one another 
		at low latencies (tens of milliseconds) to send real time alerts about possible impending collisions to 
		drivers behind them to prevent chain-reaction car accidents. This system leverages computer vision to 
		classify a given scenario as one that may result in collision. Then the system uses vehicle to vehicle 
		communications to broadcast alerts. Each vehicle, acting as a node, broadcasts information related to its speed, 
		location etc. and the other nodes receive and process this information based on the degree of relevance that 
		the message holds. The solution approach was designed over Xbee radios as a low-latency solution (~30-40ms) 
		available off-the shelf at low cost. This <a href="https://youtu.be/YszzB753P5U">video</a> and 
		<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/driverassistance">website link</a> showcases their work during the project.

	
	<p><b> 2018 Award Ceremony:</b> The concluding ceremony of this year will held on November 1 at IIT Delhi where 
 director of Marconi Society, Prof. Andrea Goldsmith (Stephen Harris Professor of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University), 
		will give an inaugural address. The ceremony will be attended by the IIT Delhi Dean Alumni Affairs & 
		International Programmes, faculty members from EE and CS, as well as industry partners. 
		The winning team will be awarded a cash prize of $1500. </p>

<h2>Brief summary of 2017 competition</h2>
<p>30 students participated in Phase I and 6 students in Phase II. The team of 6 students in Phase II 
	created a testbed in IIT Delhi experimenting with collaborative driver assistance 
	to prevent collisions with pedestrians and other vehicles; designed using cameras connected to Raspberry Pis 
	that communicate to cloud via mobile phone app. Their poster presentation was accepted at top-tier ACM MobiCom conference. This technology is being considered as a use-case for 5G pilot deployment in IIT Delhi next year. The student team is motivated to continue graduate school after their undergraduate work.</p>
<p><b> 2017 Award Ceremony:</b> Prize was awarded to the winning team Drizy on Nov 10 and was attended by Vice Chairman of <a href="http://marconisociety.org/fellows/">Marconi Society</a> <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/bob.tkach">Robert Tkach</a>. The <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~ac23/celestini/Agenda.pdf">agenda</a> and <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~ac23/celestini/Flyer.pdf">flyer</a> for the award ceremony are as follows.</p>

<p><b>How it Worked in 2017</b>
Our program focused on increasing road safety by using analytics from network of cameras mounted on vehicle dashboards.</p>
<p>Phase I (Feb 15 - Jun 1): Ten teams participated in Phase I from all over India. Each student team prototyped video analytic algorithms on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B to process video data of cameras mounted on vehicle dashboards.  The video analytics algorithms analyzed real-time from video of camera facing front of the vehicle: detect pedestrians and their trajectory, infer position or lane of the vehicle on the road, and the density of vehicles in front of the vehicle where camera is mounted. Each team trained their vision models, but the model accuracy will be tested on dataset provided from Delhi highways.</p>
<p>Phase II (Jun 1 - Sep 15): The top team from Phase I entered phase II. In phase II, the team worked at IIT Delhi to build a testbed where a network of cameras update information and receive alerts from backend servers with a visualization API to detect vehicle-to-pedestrian collisions and vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. </p>

	<h2>Details for 2019 Competition </h2>
<p>Each participating team must be comprised of two-four undergraduate students enrolled at an Indian engineering institution. The team can also involve a faculty mentor from their institution. The team must arrange equipment at their own cost for Phase I.
