<h1>Celestini Program India </h1>
</div>
	<p>The <a href="http://marconisociety.org/celestini-program/">Celestini Program</a> is a flagship effort in the Marconi Society’s mission to celebrate, inspire and connect 
	individuals building tomorrow’s technologies in service of a digitally inclusive world. </p>

<p>The Celestini Program’s objective is to inspire and connect the next generation of  
	innovators in developing countries by empowering undergraduate students to create social and 
	economic transformation in their communities through information and communications technology. 
	The Marconi Society and our Young Scholars achieve this by selecting universities with 
	promising undergrads and providing them with support and mentorship to help tap their students’ 
	true potential.

<p> 2019 was the third successful year of the Celestini program in India. 
	The program has been led by <a href="http://www.achowdhery.com">Dr. Aakanksha Chowdhery</a> (Google Research) as a director
	of the program since 2017 in collaboration with IIT Delhi. She will be joined by Prof. Rajalakshmi Nandakumar (Cornell Tech NY) 
	as a director in 2020. </p>
